In this example i created some utility classes to demonstrate little example of them

Utility classes are single-purpose CSS classes that simplify styling directly in HTML.

Why Use Them?
Consistency: Reuse predefined styles like .m-4 (margin) or .p-2 (padding).
Faster Development: No need to write custom CSSâ€”just add classes like .bg-blue-500 or .text-lg.
Responsive Design: Adjust styles easily with sm:, md:, or lg: prefixes.
Example: <div class="p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8"></div>
Less CSS, Cleaner Code: Reduces CSS bloat and maintenance.
Examples
Spacing: <div class="p-4 m-2">Content</div>
Typography: <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Heading</h1>
Layout: <div class="flex justify-center">Box</div>
Responsiveness: <div class="w-full md:w-1/2">Responsive Box</div>
Utility classes make your code faster, cleaner, and responsive-ready!
